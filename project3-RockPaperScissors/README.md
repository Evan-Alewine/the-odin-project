<p>Advancing my web-development knowledge through completing the Odin Project.</p>

<h1>Project Three: Rock Paper Scissors Game</h1>
<p>Project Three demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript for modifying webpages on the user-end. While the project instructions wanted a text based game, I decided to go with a more UI focused game.</p>
<p>The project details are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Rock Paper Scissors game, that randomly chooses the computer choice, takes the user input for the player choice, and determines the match outcome.
<ol>
<li>Create HTML Inputs, radio buttons in this case</li>
<li>Use Javascript to access HTML elements by ID and Class, as well as their input values </li>
<li>Access HTML Text and Input Values, Conditionally Modify Element Classes, and CSS style elements.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Todo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow for non-case sensitive user Text Input</li>
<li>Add score Tracking for both UI and Text games.</li>
</ul>
