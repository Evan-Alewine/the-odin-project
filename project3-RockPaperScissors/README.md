<p>Advancing my web-development knowledge through completing the Odin Project.</p>

<h1>Project Three: Rock Paper Scissors Game</h1>
<p>Project Three demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript for modifying webpages on the user-end. While the project instructions wanted a text based game, I decided to go with a more UI focused vision.</p>
<p>The project details are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Rock Paper Scissors game, that randomly chooses the computer choice, takes the user input for the player choice, and determines the match outcome.
<ol>
<li>Create HTML Inputs, namely Radio Buttons to operate as User-Input</li>
<li>Use JavaScript to access HTML Elements by ID or Class, to conditionally modify CSS Styling, Classes, and Contents.</li>
<li>Use for-loop to adjust all elements with specified class, and nested IF statements to determine match outcome.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
