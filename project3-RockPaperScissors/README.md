<p>Advancing my web-development knowledge through completing the Odin Project.</p>

<h1>Project Three: Rock Paper Scissors Game</h1>
<p>Project Three demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript for modifying webpages on the user-end.</p>
<p>The project details are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create HTML Inputs, radio buttons in this case</li>
<li>Use Javascript to access HTML elements by ID and Class, as well as their input values </li>
<li>Access HTML Text and Input Values, Conditionally Modify Element Classes, and CSS style elements.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>We now have a strong foundation in creating interactive webpages.
</ul>
