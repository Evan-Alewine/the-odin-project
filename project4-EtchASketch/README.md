<h1>Project Four: Etch-A-Sketch</h1>
<p>Project Four demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript for modifying webpages on the user-end based on listeners rather than nested if statements and user input.</p>
<p>The project details are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a user input to select the size of a grid that would be created by and added to the DOM by JavaScript, when the user hovers over the created grid that cell should turn dark.
<ol>
<li>Create HTML Inputs, namely a number-field, and reference that value in JavaScript</li>
<li>Use an iterating for-loop to add the correct number of cells and rows to a flex-box display, creating a grid.
<ol><li>Note: The use of display: grid; was against the project instructions.</li></ol></li>
<li>Add an event listener that modifies the color of created divs when the user mouses over them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
