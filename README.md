<h1>Navigation:</h1>
<p>The home-folder contains a directory of other folders to organize various 'Odin Project' material. Project folders will be titled 'project' + 'Number' + '-' + 'Descriptive-title' for easy navigation.</p>
<p>In addition to the main directory, the main folder will contain this updated README file to quickly introduce each project removing the need to open each folder to find out more about a project; unless further details are needed.</p>

<summary><h2>Project Three: Rock Paper Scissors Game</h2></summary>
<p>Project Three demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript for modifying webpages on the user-end. While the project instructions wanted a text based game, I decided to go with a more UI focused vision.</p>
<p>The project details are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Rock Paper Scissors game, that randomly chooses the computer choice, takes the user input for the player choice, and determines the match outcome.
<ol>
<li>Create HTML Inputs, namely Radio Buttons to operate as User-Input</li>
<li>Use JavaScript to access HTML Elements by ID or Class, to conditionally modify CSS Styling, Classes, and Contents.</li>
<li>Use for-loop to adjust all elements with specified class, and nested IF statements to determine match outcome.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The project details are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a user input to select the size of a grid that would be created by and added to the DOM by JavaScript, when the user hovers over the created grid that cell should turn dark.
<ol>
<li>Create HTML Inputs, namely a number-field, and reference that value in JavaScript</li>
<li>Use an iterating for-loop to add the correct number of cells and rows to a flex-box display, creating a grid.
<ol><li>Note: The use of display: grid; was against the project instructions.</li></ol></li>
<li>Add an event listener that modifies the color of created divs when the user mouses over them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
