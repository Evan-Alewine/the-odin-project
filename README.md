<p>Advancing my web-development knowledge through completing the Odin Project.</p>

<h1>Navigation:</h1>
<p>The home-folder contains a directory of other folders to organize various 'Odin Project' material. Project folders will be titled 'project' + 'Number' + '-' + 'Descriptive-title' for easy navigation.</p>
<p>In addition to the main directory, the main folder will contain this updated README file to quickly introduce each project removing the need to open each folder to find out more about a project; unless further details are needed.</p>
